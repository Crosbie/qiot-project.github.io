Hi everyone!

It's time for the QIoT community to focus on a new Edge Computing use-case.

We are calling you all for proposals as we believe our contribution should meet the expectations and the needs and should help addressing risks and challenges of the Edge Computing ecosystem: Subject Matter Experts, System Integrators, Customers, etc

A new use-case is a great stepping-stone to modernize existing architectures and keep improving the blueprints adhering to the latest specs. To give you a few examples:

* Certificate provisioning and mutual authentication
* Edge workload distribution
* Cloud-native events
* Distributed CI/CD
* Pipelines and charts

With some boundaries: 

 * [underline]#Container Platform# of choice: *Openshift*
 * [underline]#Cloud-Native framework# of choice: *Quarkus*

## Proposal submission: How to

* *Fork* the https://github.com/qiot-project/qiot-ubi-use-case-proposals[repository] we created to collect all the proposal submissions;
* Create a *sub-folder under "2021"* and name it with the name of your proposal and place all your submission content there:
** Create *README* to argument the followings:
*** Vertical (e.g.: manufacturing, automotive, telco, healthcare, etc) the use-case falls into;
*** Use-case;
*** Technology stack;
** Add everything that could draw a clear and understandable big picture of your proposal.
* Submit a PR to get your content merged;

We've set up *GitHub Discussion* on the https://github.com/qiot-project/qiot-ubi-use-case-proposals/discussions[repository] to encourage and support open discussion and debate around the submitted proposals. 

The best proposals will be put to the vote by public survey.

[underline]#*Deadline: May 24th 2021*#


_The QIoT team_
