The *QIoT Community* streams from a business initiative released and ran by Red Hat.

This initiative has been piloted on Sep 2020 for 12 selected teams, each made up of 3-5 people, challenged to implement an Edge Computing solution using _enterprise_ and _opensource_ technologies.

The top 3 teams have been awarded and invited to join us in a discussion hosted by https://www.openshift.com/streaming/twitch[*openshift tv*]

Watch the episode linked below to get an overview of the first draft of the QIoT project and the initial idea behind the QIoT Hackfest event!
