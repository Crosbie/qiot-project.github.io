A warm welcome to all the guests of the QIoT project community!

A few months ago, back in November 2020, a small group of redhatters in love with opensource spotted the opportunity to create a forum to discuss about innovation, have fun and tackle technical and business challenges.

We are seing this community growing organically and attracting more and more SMEs bringing new ideas and contribution to out PoCs.

Feel free to have a look, investigate, test and leave a feedback.

We look forward to have you joining the project!
