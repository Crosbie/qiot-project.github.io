	<p>
		The “Quarkus & IoT” (QIoT) community was born in late 2020 from a Red Hat initiative focusing on empowering IoT and Edge computing using Red Hat cloud-native technologies: the QIoT Hackfest.
	</p>
	<p>
		We decided to create this community starting from the project implemented for the QIoT Hackfest and work on its improvements to make it more Edge/Computing compliant.
	</p>
	<p>
		This community is contributed by subject matter experts from several companies, specialized in different areas (cloud-native development, container technology, IoT, security, data analytics) driven by passion and willingness to collaborate on the design and implementation of solutions dedicated to the IoT and edge/computing market.
	</p>
	<p>
		Short term goal of the QIoT community is to have fun and grow together, learning from each other.
	</p>
	<p>	 
		The long term goal is to implement new PoCs covering different IoT verticals on the Market using Quarkus, Openshift and other community projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		QIoT is an OPEN community always looking for new members. If you are keen to learn and have fun with us please join our <a href="http://quarkusforiottechteam.slack.com">slack channel</a>.
